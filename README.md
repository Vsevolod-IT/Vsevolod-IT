## Hello, my name is Vsevolod 

## :man_technologist: About Me :

- I am constantly developing. One of my goals is to become a full-fledged | **full-stack developer** |
- English language skills :gb:  **B2** (on my way of improving it)
- Learning Spanish :es: I intend to move to Argentina :argentina:

## :broken_heart: my pain:
I've worked hard for a long time to get a job at Epam Systems. I was able to enroll in evening courses and after them to have an internship. 
After 5 months of training which I passed with honors and also after passing the exam for software developer I was supposed to become an employee of the company and worked on projects. 
Unfortunatelly, the state (which I do not support) started a war. Of course, the company had difficulties and therefore I was not able to join the team. For me it is a pain because I've pushed lots of my efforts to achieve my goal. 
On an internship I worked on a very large project which is used within the company (I have no right to disclose more) therefore my internship experience can be considered as a full-fledged work on a complex project. 
Below I will attach responses of the mentors about my work.
